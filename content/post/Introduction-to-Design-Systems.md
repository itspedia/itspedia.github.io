# Six interlocking areas that make up a design system
1. Layout: Defined measures that make up your spacing and grid system.
2. Styles: Core aspects of your visual language. These include colors, iconography, and typography.
3. Components: Core elements of an interface. These include buttons and form fields.
4. Regions: Overarching design paradigms, such as navigation or search.
5. Content: Information regarding the voice and tone, as well as punctuation guidelines. Content can also include terminology if your product has a specific vocabulary.
6. Usability: Rules that define accessibility and internationalization.


## Terms used for referencing different aspects within design systems:
- Elements: The lowest-level object. Elements cannot be broken down further. This can include labels and icons.
- Components : A combination of one or more elements that function as a whole, such as a form.
- Component groups: A group of components that form a larger component.

## Style Guides, Component Libraries, and Design Systems
- Style guide: Static documentation that defines how the brand is stylistically applied to interface elements. It contains high-level details about color, typography, iconography, and more.
- Component library: A set of styles and components that can be used and shared among a team. A component library consists of common core elements that are used throughout an application. If supported by a design tool, they can automatically sync across design files when a change is made. Component libraries may or may not include living code.
- Design system: A series of documented elements, components, and regions that include both design and front-end guidelines. The documentation contains live code examples, allowing cross-functional teams to easily reuse styles and components in several instances across an application. A design system also includes underlying design principles, rules, and guidelines that help a team build one or multiple products.
