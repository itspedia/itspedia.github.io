# Six interlocking areas that make up a design system
1. Layout: Defined measures that make up your spacing and grid system.
2. Styles: Core aspects of your visual language. These include colors, iconography, and typography.
3. Components: Core elements of an interface. These include buttons and form fields.
4. Regions: Overarching design paradigms, such as navigation or search.
5. Content: Information regarding the voice and tone, as well as punctuation guidelines. Content can also include terminology if your product has a specific vocabulary.
6. Usability: Rules that define accessibility and internationalization.
